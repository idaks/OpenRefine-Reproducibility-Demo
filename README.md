# OpenRefine Reproducibility Demo

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/idaks/openrefine-reproducibility/master)

Demo contains two parts:
- openrefine_reproducibility_ui.md: a static markdown shows how we can reproduce openrefine operations through the openrefine_ui
- openrefine_reproducibility_api.ipynb: a jupyter notebook shows how we can reproduce complete openrefine operations using the openrefine python api. We introduce a command line interface application to apply the complete recipe on the openrefine server.
